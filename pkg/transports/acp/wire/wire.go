// Package wire is the ACP stdio transport composition boundary.
//
// Wire performs construction only: it injects the explicit collaborators an
// ACP acp.Server needs and starts no goroutine, process, listener, session,
// or persistence. Callers inject their own streams into the returned
// Server's Serve method; wire never reads process-global stdio itself, so
// this package introduces no dependency bag, service locator, or secondary
// injector.
