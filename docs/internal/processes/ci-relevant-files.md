# CI Relevant Files

## Pull-request verification workflow

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns pull-request and `main` CI lane scheduling.
  Windows Go suite coverage is a `windows-go-tests` matrix with independent
  `Unit`, `Functional`, `Stress`, and `Release` jobs. Keep `fail-fast: false`,
  preserve each job's Windows setup, and invoke the matching repository-owned
  local command (`make test-unit`, `make test-functional`, `make test-stress`,
  or `make test-release`). Each lane writes that command to its job summary so
  a failed CI result has a direct local rerun.
