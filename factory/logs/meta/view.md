## world state

- as of `2026-05-03T10:03:19.3588030-07:00`, local `HEAD` on `main` points to
  `a47afae` (`Merge pull request #70 from
  portpowered/ralph/import-export-bundled-files-disk-backed-roundtrip`) and
  matches `origin/main`; there are two open PRs relevant to the active ask:
  `#69` `workstation-non-success-route-arrays` and `#71`
  `dashboard-import-export-dialog-extraction-and-button-standardization`
- the local worktree is not clean:
  - tracked local edits exist in `factory/logs/meta/asks.md` and
    `factory/workstations/cleaner/AGENTS.md`
  - untracked local planning residue exists in
    `factory/scripts/import-export-p0-followups.json`
- the canonical maintainer ask surface remains `factory/logs/meta/asks.md`, and
  the active P0 remains import/export and contract cleanup, now expanded with a
  separate multi-output workstation-route ask

## workflow truth

- `factory/factory.json` still defines five work types: `thoughts`, `idea`,
  `plan`, `task`, and `cron-triggers`
- the checked-in maintainer loop remains:
  `thoughts:init -> ideafy -> thoughts:complete`
  `idea:init -> plan -> idea:to-complete + plan:init`
  `plan:init -> setup-workspace -> plan:complete + task:init`
  `task:init -> process -> task:in-review -> review -> task:to-complete`
  `consume` completes same-name `idea` + `task` pairs once both reach
  `to-complete`
- topology details that still matter:
  - `process` and `review` run in `.claude/worktrees/{{name}}`
  - shared `executor-slot` capacity is `10`; each staffed workstation requests
    `1`
  - hourly `cleaner` emits `cron-triggers:complete`
  - `executor-loop-breaker` fails `task:init` after `process` visit `50`
  - `review-loop-breaker` fails `task:in-review` after `review` visit `10`

## input surface truth

- tracked `factory/inputs/**` content is still sentinel-only:
  - `factory/inputs/BATCH/default/.gitkeep`
  - `factory/inputs/idea/default/.gitkeep`
  - `factory/inputs/plan/default/.gitkeep`
  - `factory/inputs/task/default/.gitkeep`
  - `factory/inputs/thoughts/default/.gitkeep`
- `.gitignore` still ignores live workflow submissions under `factory/inputs/**`
  except those sentinel paths
- the current checkout also contains ignored operating residue related to the
  active ask:
  - `factory/inputs/thoughts/default/import-export-issues.md`
  - `factory/inputs/idea/default/workstation-non-success-route-arrays.md`
- the local repository root also contains untracked planning residue outside the
  canonical inboxes:
  - `factory/scripts/import-export-p0-followups.json`
- the watcher still accepts direct `factory/inputs/<work-type>/...` paths as
  the default channel even though the public docs emphasize the
  `factory/inputs/<work_type-or-BATCH>/<channel>/<filename>` layout

## customer-ask truth

- the highest-priority live ask is the import/export P0 in
  `factory/logs/meta/asks.md`, not the older throttle cleanup lane
- three earlier import/export cleanup requests have now landed on `main`:
  - PR `#67` removed exported workstation `promptTemplate` from the public
    contract
  - PR `#68` moved worker/workstation body ownership into split body-only
    `AGENTS.md` files with a thinner authored layout
  - PR `#70` made supported bundled-file import/export round-trips disk-backed
    by default
- the local helper batch in `factory/scripts/import-export-p0-followups.json`
  is now more stale: it still lists the prompt-template, split-layout, and
  bundled-file lanes even though those changes are merged, while its dialog and
  standards items remain relevant
- `factory/logs/meta/asks.md` also contains a backend contract ask that is not
  represented in that helper batch:
  - replace singular workstation `onContinue`, `onRejection`, and `onFailure`
    destinations with array-based outputs
- the remaining import/export seams on `main` are now narrower:
  - the dashboard import/export dialog and button-standardization lane is now
    actively owned by open PR `#71` on branch
    `ralph/dashboard-import-export-dialog-extraction-and-button-standardization`
  - the standards-alignment checklist and gap-closure lane remains open in the
    ask surface, is still tracked in `factory/logs/meta/progress.txt`, and does
    not yet have a corresponding open PR
- the live code also shows the route-array ask is real on `main`, but it is no
  longer unowned:
  - `api/components/schemas/data-models/Workstation.yaml`,
    `api/openapi.yaml`, `pkg/api/generated/server.gen.go`,
    `pkg/generatedclient/client.gen.go`, and
    `ui/src/api/generated/openapi.ts` still expose singular
    `onContinue`/`onRejection`/`onFailure` fields beside array-valued
    `outputs`
  - `pkg/interfaces/factory_config.go`, `pkg/config/layout.go`,
    `pkg/config/factory_config_mapping.go`, and `pkg/config/config_mapper.go`
    still model non-success routes as single destinations
  - `pkg/factory/event_history.go` and
    `pkg/factory/projections/world_state.go` still collapse route arrays down
    to one public `WorkstationIO`
  - `ui/src/api/factory-definition/api.ts` still parses `onRejection` and
    `onFailure` as singular objects and currently drops `onContinue` on import
  - open PR `#69` already carries the corresponding cross-layer fix on branch
    `ralph/workstation-non-success-route-arrays`
- test coverage already exists around these seams, but it currently protects the
  old contract in several places:
  - `pkg/api/factory_config_smoke_test.go`
  - `pkg/config/factory_config_mapping_test.go`
  - `pkg/config/portable_bundled_files_test.go`
  - `tests/functional/runtime_api/api_runtime_config_alignment_smoke_test.go`
  - `tests/functional/bootstrap_portability/agent_factory_export_import_fixture_test.go`
  - `pkg/api/openapi_contract_test.go`
  - `pkg/config/config_mapper_test.go`
  - `pkg/config/config_validator_test.go`
  - `pkg/replay/event_artifact_test.go`
  - `pkg/factory/projections/world_state_test.go`
  - `pkg/cli/init/init_test.go`
  - `ui/src/api/factory-definition/api.test.ts`
  - `ui/src/features/timeline/state/factoryTimelineStore.test.ts`

## replay truth

- `factory/logs/agent-fails.json` and
  `factory/logs/agent-fails.replay.json` remain the checked-in replay sample
  pair described in `factory/README.md`
- the replay pair is still historical fixture coverage rather than an exact copy
  of the current workflow contract; it predates `to-complete` states, `consume`,
  and the current `executor-slot` capacity of `10`
- replay outcome counts remain unchanged in the sample:
  - `process`: `9 ACCEPTED <COMPLETE>`, `27 CONTINUE <CONTINUE>`
  - `review`: `5 ACCEPTED <COMPLETE>`, `4 REJECTED <REJECTED>`

## recent repo movement

- recent merged PRs on `main` now include:
  - `#70` `import-export-bundled-files-disk-backed-roundtrip`, merged on
    `2026-05-03`
  - `#68` `import-export-expanded-agents-layout-for-workers-and-workstations`
    merged on `2026-05-03`
  - `#67` `import-export-api-contract-remove-workstation-prompt-template`
    merged on `2026-05-03`
  - `#66` `add fixes for edges missing` merged on `2026-05-03`
  - `#65` `retire-dashboard-format-helper-ownership`
  - `#64` `retire-dashboard-bento-layout-ownership`
  - `#63` `retire-current-selection-inference-duplication`
  - `#62` `align-dashboard-work-summary-count-semantics`
- there are two open PRs directly tied to the remaining P0 cleanup:
  - `#69` `workstation-non-success-route-arrays`, opened on `2026-05-03`
  - `#71` `dashboard-import-export-dialog-extraction-and-button-standardization`,
    opened on `2026-05-03`

## theory of mind

- the authoritative world model still comes from live git state plus the
  checked-in workflow contract, not from replay fixtures alone
- `factory/inputs/**` must always be reasoned about in two layers:
  checked-in contract versus ignored operating residue
- helper planning residue can go stale quickly once related PRs merge, so the
  meta loop has to reconcile ignored backlog files against `main` and open PR
  state before dispatching anything new
- the prompt-template, split-layout, and bundled-file asks are now landed on
  `main`; the remaining import/export backlog is dialog/button cleanup,
  standards alignment, and the array-based non-success route contract
- the route-array contract cleanup is already actively owned by ignored local
  residue plus open PR `#69`, so queuing another idea for it would be
  duplicative
- the dialog/button cleanup is also already actively owned by open PR `#71`, so
  queuing another idea for it would likewise be duplicative
- the only remaining P0 import/export follow-up that still appears unowned is
  the standards-alignment checklist and gap-closure lane, but the existing
  helper batch for that lane is outside the canonical watched inbox and partly
  stale
- the right durable meta action in this iteration is to refresh the checked-in
  world view and progress surfaces only, leaving execution with the existing
  import/export branches and PRs rather than duplicating queue work
